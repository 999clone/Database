# 🗃️ Simple In-Memory Database with Serialization

This is a lightweight Java-based **in-memory database** system designed for managing entities such as Tasks and Steps.  
The project supports basic data operations, validation, and serialization to file storage. While it primarily operates in-memory, data can be **persisted to a file** (`db.txt`) using custom serializers.  
The project allows you to store, update, and retrieve entities in memory and save them manually to disk when needed.
